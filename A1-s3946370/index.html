					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Over the past decade, technology has been advancing exponentially. This meant that with
              each surpassing year, new devices would get released with improved features over their
              predecessors. Since I was only 10 at the time with no income or money, I would always
              dream of having the latest technologies with the upgraded features as I would watch
              unboxing and review videos on gaming consoles, computers and mobiles phones. I would
              later on receive my first ever MacBook Pro which was a 2008 model in 2014 which I mostly
              played Minecraft on. However, due to the age of the laptop, there were many issues to be
              resolved such as poor battery performance and troubleshooting issues which I would always
              search on YouTube the best way to fix these issues. This was the beginning of what got me
              into technology as it was an extremely rewarding experience being able to resolve any
              technical issues whist learning something new.</p>

          <p>After high school, I was extremely confused on what I wanted to do and where I wanted to go
              for university, so I did what most people would do in my situation and take a small break
              from academics for half a year and began working as a real estate agent which I later realised
              I didn’t enjoy as much as it was not the lifestyle I wanted. I then applied for a customer
              service role working on a government contract for the Australian Taxation Office which I
              then came to a realisation that perhaps working right now would not be the best thing for me
              to do at the time, so I decided to continue studying.</p>

          <p>I decided to further engage my studies at RMIT mainly due to the reputation that it held for
              being one of the best universities for Bachelor of Information Technology in Melbourne.
              Additionally, I decided to study at RMIT because of my brother who is studying Computer
              Science told me to commence my higher education at RMIT which I am really enjoying right
              now due to how many resources are allocated towards students and the amount of support
              students receive from mentors who have previously or are currently studying IT.</p>

          <p>Whilst studying IT, I expect to learn how to balance different aspects of work and life to
              assist me in organisation, time management and communication skills as they are some of the
              skills that I would consider my weakest to become an all-round individual. I expect to learn
              about programming, how computer work, how databases work, web programming and
              eventually full stack development which will eventually prepare me for a long-term career in
              web developing.</p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
          <p><img src="Ideal_Job.png" alt="Ideal_j"
            width="90%"
            height="auto"></p>
          <p>As I am a firm believer of working your way up the corporate ladder, it would best suit my
              needs that I work on an internship at a company such as Deloitte or EY starting out on a
              casual basis to part-time work and eventually to full-time work as a long-term career. Being
              the person I am, I like to enjoy a work-life balance possibly working three to four days a
              week.</p>
          <p>
              I chose my ideal job as a software developer as I am much passionate about helping people or
              clients in this case meet their needs. I would say I find a lot of joy in helping people and
              being able to turn their ideas into a reality would be such a rewarding experience to me.
              This role would require background knowledge in software development in C#, specification
              reviews, liaising with customers and Systems Engineering group, task planning and
              management, code reviews, issue and bug tracking, customer and support liaison and
              technical documentation.
              </p>

          <p>It is said in the profession requirements of the job description that successful applicants will
              have “attention to detail”, will be “creative, self-motivated” and must be “able to work to
              deadlines and schedules”. I believe that this job would best suit my needs as an aspiring
              software developer as I am one to have a keen eye (attention to detail) and as some would say
              I am much of a perfectioning – wanting the work done in a professional yet pleasingly
              aesthetic manner. Additionally, I have excellent spoken and written English skills allowing
              me to communicate in a professional manner towards potential clients.
              As to the other skills required, I expect to finish my Bachelor of Information Technology
              majoring in software development by the year 2026 to obtain strong computer literacy
              allowing me to have experience in software development as well as providing me with
              experience in creating technical documents.</p>

            width="90%"
            height="auto"></p>
          <p>For my first test, I conducted a personality test on the 16 personalities website to further
              understand who I am as an individual and it is found that I am “57% introverted, 58%
              observant, 54% feeling, 61% prospecting and 61% turbulent. After conducting the test, I
              found that I am a “Turbulent Adventurer (ISFP- T)” which has not come to my surprise
              however as these results closely indicate who I am as a person</p>

            height="auto"></p>
          <p>For my second test, I conducted a learning style test on education planner to better understand
              how I learn and it is found that I am “35% Auditory, 25% Visual and 40% Tactile. Again, I
              am not surprised as to how accurate these results are. As I predominately am a tactile learner
              I like to “physically touch or try something” to truly understand how to “learn the concept
              best”</p>

					<h2>High5test</h2>

            width="90%"
            height="auto">test3</p>
          <p>For my final test, I conducted an online test which identified my five top strengths and to my
              surprise I found that my top strength is time keeping which after reading about the
              description strongly relates to me as I plan my deadlines and do not enjoy surprises.
              Following this, my second strongest is self-believer followed by empathizer, catalyst and
              commander.</p>

          <h3>What do these results mean to me</h3>
          <p>These results mean a lot to me as it allows me to truly understand who I am as a person, my
              strengths and weaknesses as well as how to best overcome those weaknesses. These tests
              have indicated to me in detail why I may not enjoy going out with a big group of friends, why
              I’ve always struggled reading books or why I may get displeased to last minute tasks.</p>

          <h3>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team</h3>
          <p>I believe that although these results indicate who I am as a person with a high accuracy rate,
              it may seem somewhat vague in a sense of how it may influence my behaviour in a team such
              as, I as an individual may be partially introverted, it would not mean that I would not be
              willing to do the work with a team or communicate effectively. However, for the second test,
              now that I truly understand my learning style, it may not be as effective opposed to a
              colleague who would be considered a visual or a auditory learner. In essence, I believe that
              these results turn out to be what you make it to be.</p>

          <h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team</h3>
          <p>I believe that I would take these tests with a grain of salt when forming a team as everyone
              will subconsciously have a bias when forming a team. Additionally, everyone is unique in
              terms of personality, learning styles and strengths making it difficult for everyone to choose a
              group with the people they relate to. However, I am a person who is extremely valuable with
              my time as indicated in the third test. Therefore, I would choose someone I can get along
              with easily as well as someone who is willing to do the work regardless of their personality
              traits, learning styles or strengths.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>Livesimpl. An all-in-one application designed to simplify life. An app which provides individuals to meet their gym goals, improve their sleep and nutrition habits whilst allowing them to manage their work-life balance all in one. The app features an effective yet simple calendar for individuals like us to plan our days, weeks and time better. Livesimpl provides gym programs specific to your goals and needs and sets up a nutrition plan personally for its user based on the timeframe you have set. The app also tracks your overall sleep quality and sets a reminder for bedtime and an alarm.</p>

					<h2>Motivation</h2>

					<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1154994/number-us-fitness-health-app-users/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/1154994/number-us-fitness-health-app-users/</a>
          <p><img src="Project-idea.png" alt="project-idea"

            height="auto"></p>

          <p>The above image showcases the amounts of adults per million that uses a health and fitness
            app from the year 2018 to the year 2022 in the US alone.</p>

          <p>Statistics indicate that from the year 2018, 62.7 million people used a health and fitness app
            rising to 68.7 million users in 2019 following a substantial increase to 87.4 million users in
            2020 reaching its all-time high. However, in the year 2021, the amounts of users decreased
            slightly to 84 million users due to the impact of COVID-19 on many users. Yet, in the year
            2022, health and fitness apps started to pick up from where they left off back to 86.3 million
            users, just a small fraction over 1 million users less.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The app once downloaded will ask you to create a profile for yourself requiring you to enter
              details such as name, age, email, password, weight, height, nutrition such as, daily intake on
              how many calories you’re consuming a day, body physique, how many days you’re willing to
              dedicate to workout and the amount of time you want to give yourself to be the best version
              of yourself. Once an account has been created, the app will calibrate and restart which once
              opened again will contain different categories such as fitness, nutrition, sleep and calendar as
              soon as you start the application.</p>

          <p>In the fitness category, it will contain detailed breakdowns of the workout such as how to
              perform a certain movement, what specific muscle group the exercise will target, how many
              sets and repetitions would be required and the time frame of the whole workout itself.
              Additionally, after we have many yearly users, we will integrate the app into an apple watch
              where users are able to track the amount of calories they’ve burnt throughout the session as
              well as their average heart rate and intensity of the workout.</p>

          <p>In the nutrition category, it will contain your calories and macros. The nutrition category will
              be based solely on whether or not you decide to track every food intake you put into your
              body. Users are expected to weigh how much meat they use to create their food and choose
              which meat they’re using whether it be pork, beef or chicken. At the end of the day, the app
              will provide a breakdown of their calories providing the statistics on how many carbs, fat,
              protein, salt and sugar has been consumer and whether they should decrease or increase it.</p>

          <p>In the sleep category, it will contain your sleep habits such as what time you sleep and what
              time you wake up. After a week of understanding your sleep pattern, it will provide what time
              you should sleep, when you should wake up and how many hours you’re expected to sleep as
              well as have the ability to monitor your sleep such as sleep talking, snoring and how many
              times you may wake up during the night.</p>

          <p>In the calendar, it will contain a timetable which breaks down into days and allows you to
              categorise your meetings, work/study and gym as well as many more tasks you may have for
              the day allowing you to set your day up in a more productive and efficient manner as the app
              will be used many times during the day. If allowed, the app will send notifications to your
              phone with tasks you have for the day 10 minutes prior to it or within the timeframe you set.</p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<a href="https://flutter.dev/">https://flutter.dev/</a>
          <p>For this project I will be using “Flutter” which is an open-source UI Software Development
              Kit (SDK) to create the application which is trusted by many big companies such as Google,
              BMW, ebay and many more which would require extensive amounts of coding to make the
              app as effective as possible for the millions of users to use worldwide.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>The skills required would be extensive background knowledge in coding and app
              development.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If the project is successful, it would change the lives of many users worldwide in different
              aspects such as fitness, nutrition, sleep and work habits. Potentially, with the amount of users
              I hope that the app will gain great amounts of media attention allowing it to be recognised by
              big companies such as Nike providing discounts to those that use the app for the fitness
              aspect as well as Hellofresh for the nutrition aspect of the app allowing everyone to get fit
              and healthy as well as maintain it.</p>
